Submitted by: Vatsal Gupta

Time spent: 10 hours spent in total

6 User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [Y] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [Y] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [Y] UI animations
* [Y] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [Y] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [Y] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

## Notes

It was my first iOS app and I found it very interesting. It was little difficult in the begining to understand different objects that were
passed in as arguments. Also, calling a function was little confusing mainly because of 'sender' object. I finally was able to figure it out.

Another challenge was to understand View OCntroller's lifecycle. It took me some time to understand which which function gets executed at what time and where all the dynamic code should go like chaanging color based on setting, changing tip percentages based on setting or even animating objects.

I really had fun working with xCode and Swift.
